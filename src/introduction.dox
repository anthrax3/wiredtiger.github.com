/*! @mainpage Reference Guide

WiredTiger is an extensible platform for data management.  This
documentation describes the programming interface to WiredTiger used by
developers to construct applications.

We follow SQL terminology: a database is set of tables managed together.
Tables consist of rows, where each row is a key and its associated
value.  Tables may optionally have an associated schema, splitting the
value into a set of columns.  Tables may also have associated indices,
each of which is ordered by one or more columns.

In addition to the traditional row-oriented storage where all columns
of a row are stored together, WiredTiger supports column-oriented
storage, where one or more columns can be stored individually, allowing
more efficient access and storage.
