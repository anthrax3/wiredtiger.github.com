/*! @page home WiredTiger Home Directory

WiredTiger file naming is based on the \c home argument specified to the
::wiredtiger_open function and the \c WIREDTIGER_HOME environment
variable.

If a \c home argument is specified to the ::wiredtiger_open function,
its value is used as the database directory and the \c WIREDTIGER_HOME
environment variable is always ignored.

If no \c home argument is specified to the ::wiredtiger_open function
and the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable is not set, the database
directory is the process' current working directory.  No current working
directory path is maintained by the WiredTiger software and changing the
working directory after opening the WiredTiger database may cause
failure.

If no \c home argument is specified to the ::wiredtiger_open function,
the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable is set, and the
::wiredtiger_open function was configured with the \c home_environment
string, the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable value is used as the
database directory.

If no \c home argument is specified to the ::wiredtiger_open function,
the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable is set, the ::wiredtiger_open
function was configured with the \c home_environment_priv string, and
the user has appropriate privileges, the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment
value is used as the database directory.  (The \c home_environment_priv
string is intended for applications that have or acquire special
privileges and wish to ensure an environment-specified home directory
is ignored unless the program is executed by a user with appropriate
permissions: if such an application does not configure the
::wiredtiger_open function with the \c home_environment_priv string,
setting an environment value will cause the open to fail unless the user
has appropriate permissions.  On ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (POSIX.1) systems,
"appropriate permissions" is defined as a real user ID of 0.)

If no \c home argument is specified to the ::wiredtiger_open function,
the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable is set, and the
::wiredtiger_open function was not configured with either the \c
home_environment or \c home_environment_priv strings, the open will
fail.

Finally, consider security when configuring WiredTiger to use the
WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable, especially in applications which
run with permissions other than the user's.  Such applications are
potentially vulnerable to allowing users access to databases they could
not otherwise access.

@section home_config Home directory configuration strings

The WiredTiger home directory optionally includes a file named \c
WiredTiger.config.  If this file exists when ::wiredtiger_open is
called, it is read for configuration strings.  See @subpage config_file
for details.
