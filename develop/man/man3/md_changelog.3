.PP
The WiredTiger 2\&.5\&.1 release contains new features, minor API changes and many bug fixes\&.
.PP
New features and API changes:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a new 'log=(recover=on)' option to \fBwiredtiger_open\fP\&. The default value is 'on', if set to 'error', recovery won't be run on startup\&. An error will be returned if recovery is needed but disabled\&. This option is mainly to support the WiredTiger command line utility\&. refs #1651
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a new \fBWT_CURSOR::equals\fP method that returns when the cursors are equal, intended as a fast-path for cursor comparison\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Change how statistics work when there are checkpoints for an object\&. We used to aggregate statistics for all open checkpoints and the current handle\&. We now only return statistics for the object being queried\&. See upgrading documentation for further information\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a mode to LSM that allows us to limit the size of a tree by dropping old chunks\&. Enabled via 'lsm=(chunk_count_limit=0)', default to 0 which disables the functionality\&. Note that enabling this feature discards old data automatically\&. refs #1652
.IP "\(bu" 2
Update the WiredTiger printlog command line utility to generate JSON that can be parsed by third party tools\&. refs #1438
.IP "\(bu" 2
Change how we track memory allocation overhead\&. We used to apply a fixed size for each allocation (which was difficult to track)\&. The overhead can be specified via a new configuration option to \fBwiredtiger_open\fP using 'cache_overhead=8'\&. The value is a percentage and the default is 8\&. refs #1564 #1565
.IP "\(bu" 2
Major enhancements to the wtstats\&.py tool that translates WiredTiger statistics into an HTML graph\&. The tool now generates interactive graphs and no longer requires third party Python libraries to be installed\&.

Now that WiredTiger is part of MongoDB, we are tracking issues related to MongoDB usage of WiredTiger in the MongoDB JIRA system\&. Some entries in the changelog now reference JIRA tickets that can be found at:
.PP
http://jira.mongodb.org
.PP
New features and API changes:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add support for storing large values on-page in a btree rather than in an overflow item\&. This is useful for workloads that want to keep large items in cache - since WiredTiger overflow items are never cached\&. It is configured via new \fCleaf_value_max\fP configuration setting\&. This enhancement led to the deprecation of internal_item_max and leaf_item_max configuration settings, see upgrading documentation for further information\&. [#1282]
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add support for compressing log files\&. When configured each compressible log record will be compressed\&. This is configure with the \fClog=(compressor=X)\fP configuration setting\&. See upgrading documentation for further information\&. [#1359]
.IP "\(bu" 2
No longer return EBUSY when opening a bulk cursor, verifying or salvaging a database if a checkpoint is currently running\&. This allows applications to do these exclusive operations without shutting down the checkpoint server thread\&. [#1397] [#1404] \fCSERVER-16236\fP \fCSERVER-16457\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2

Have the eviction server write out unnecessary pages prior to the cache reaching the configured eviction trigger size\&. This can reduce the amount of eviction application threads do when configured with a large cache\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Several enhancements to managing how long we keep files open
.IP "\(bu" 2
Revert a change in the 2\&.4\&.1 release that caused the WT_ROLLBACK (and deprecated WT_DEADLOCK) error return to map to different numeric values\&. Applications should ensure they are compiling against the same version of the wiredtiger\&.h header file as the library they link against, otherwise odd behavior will be experienced\&.

Changes relevant for upgrading applications:
.PP
Update the table create API to disable prefix compression by default\&. Applications generally see better performance without prefix compression, choosing space saving over performance is up to the application\&. [#981]
.PP
Change the default leaf_page_max setting from 1MB to 32KB\&. Choosing a large default leaf_page_max led to poor performance in out of cache workloads\&.
.PP
Remove the \fC--enable-debug\fP option to configure\&. It is more standard to set \fCCFLAGS='-g'\fP variable instead\&.
.PP
Save the wiredtiger_open configuration when a database is created, so that settings like cache size, extensions and logging are set consistently by all subsequent users of the database\&.
.PP
Add an \fC--enable-verbose\fP option to configure\&. In order to access the verbose message functionality available as part of the wiredtiger_open and \fBWT_CONNECTION::reconfigure\fP APIs, it is necessary to pass the \fC--enable-verbose\fP option to configure\&.
.PP
Enhance the metadata cursor implementation (i\&.e: cursors created with a 'metadata:' prefix) so that they can be used to inspect metadata for internal tables and now support altering the metadata\&. Add a new 'read_only' flag to cursor configuration that defaults to false for metadata cursors\&.
.PP
Fix several bugs in raw compression, including one that could cause data corruption and some that triggered poor performance\&. [#984][#991][#1007][#1008][#1013]

.IP "\(bu" 2
Add maximum filesystem buffer cache settings to wiredtiger_open called 'os_cache_max' and 'os_cache_dirty_max'\&. After doing the specified amount of reads or writes, WiredTiger will call fadvise and/or sync_file_range to drop pages from the filesystem cache\&.

support for online compaction of files;
.IP "\(bu" 2
support for tables, column groups and indices that use LSM trees for storage; and
.IP "\(bu" 2
improved statistics and configuration for LSM trees and Bloom filters\&.
.PP
.PP
In addition, there are some significant performance improvements and bug fixes\&. The full list of changes is:
.PP
[#248] Add support for online compaction\&.
.PP
[#310] Fixed a bug where overflow blocks could be accessed by a long-running reader after they had been freed in a checkpoint\&.
.PP
[#358] Allocate checkpoint blocks from the live system's list of available blocks rather than always extending the file\&.
.PP
[#361] Sync the directory after creating a file: this is apparently required for durability on Linux, according to the Linux fsync man page\&.
.PP
[#362] Don't check if a page is on the avail or discard lists if we're salvaging the file, that is okay\&.
.PP
[#363] Remove obsolete code dealing with forced eviction\&.
.PP
[#366] Fake checkpoints may have the delete flag set, ignore them when rolling checkpoints forward\&.
.PP
[#367] All metadata reads should ignore the application's transactional context\&.
.PP
[#369] Support LSM as a data source for tables, column groups and indices\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add tuning options for LSM bloom filters, including controlling whether the oldest level in the tree has a Bloom filter, whether newly-created (level 0) files have Bloom filters, and passing arbitrary file configuration for Bloom filters\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a merge generation to LSM chunks\&. Add a statistic that reports the highest merge generation in a tree\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a new LSM statistic tracking searches that could benefit from bloom filters\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Enable LSM statistics in the 'wt stat' utility\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Interrupt LSM merge operations, rather than waiting on close\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Wait for a while before looking for LSM major merges, in case merges catch up with inserts\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix LSM index searches\&. The main issue was LSM search_near was not always returning the closest key to the search key, which calling code expects\&. It now tries hard to find the smallest cursor larger than the search key, and only if no larger record exists does it return the largest record smaller than the search key\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Reset any old cursor position before an LSM search\&. This limits hazard references in an LSM search to a single chunk\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix a memory leak in an error path in Bloom filters\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Tweak the search loops in hazard_{set,clear} in favor of last-in-first-out ordering\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
If there are many files open, some hotter than others, walk more files looking for pages to evict\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Don't stop evicting until we reach the target, have eviction wake up periodically regardless of whether the application signals it\&. This latter requires a 'timed condition wait' operation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Tweaks to file handle flags for out-of-cache read performance on Linux (disable read-ahead and access time updates)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Replace the WT_SESSION::dumpfile method with configuration strings to \fBWT_SESSION::verify\fP\&.

Fix a bug where we weren't skipping unnecessary default checkpoints because we weren't handling the generational number included in the internal checkpoint name\&.

Add a 'force' configuration flag to \fBWT_SESSION::checkpoint\fP, object compaction needs it because the work it wants done is done by the block manager\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Make compact and checkpoint operate on a table's indices\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
When doing a page truncate, lock down the page before we unpack the on-page cell -- it's possible the page could be instantiated, modified and reconciled while we're sleeping, in which case the WT_REF\&.addr field would no longer point on-page\&.

This is a bugfix and performance tuning release, primarily related to LSM trees\&. The changes are as follows:
.PP
[#350] Checkpoint the metadata after successful schema-level operations\&. Otherwise, if process exits without closing the connection or running a checkpoint, created objects exist but there is no record in the metadata\&.
.PP
[#351] Don't put checkpoint extent blocks on the available list, blocks on it are considered for truncation; they have to go on the 'checkpoint
       available' list\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Choose LSM merges based on a measure of efficiency (levels collapsed per record), rather than simply choosing a minor or a major merge\&. Tweak the merge heuristic so we don't end up with runs of smaller chunks in the middle of the tree\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a connection-wide flag to disable LSM merges\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Don't create Bloom filters for the oldest chunk in the system\&. Add the ability to disable Bloom filters entirely\&.

Implement minor merges for LSM trees, prefer them to major merges\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Update hazard references, so the active array grows as needed\&. Change the default hazard_max to 1000\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Abort transactions if the cache is so full that they cannot make progress\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix a bug where verify could crash if an empty checkpoint exists\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Make the maximum number of chunks for merges configurable, rather than deriving a value from the number of hazard references available\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Switch to an atomic add to allocate transaction IDs\&. This fixes a subtle race before where two threads could temporarily have the same ID in the global state table\&. If one of the threads timed out and the other thread committed its transaction with that ID, the commit would not become visible immediately\&. This could lead to deadlock errors in workloads that are logically conflict-free\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Have auto-commit transactions retry deadlocks\&. This requires that we keep the user's key and value in the cursor\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Simplify the code handling updated records in variable-length column-store reconciliation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Never wait for eviction when holding the schema lock\&. This avoids deadlocks between opening a column store file and taking a checkpoint\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Take care with the loop termination when walking files for eviction\&. We were making one extra call into __wt_tree_walk, which would leave a leaf page in the WT_REF_EVICT_WALK state, unable to be evicted\&. In some workloads, including LSM loads, we could end up with many files all consisting of a single leaf page, none of which could be evicted\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Pause updates when the cache is full\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
In files marked as 'out of cache', don't wait for eviction when reading a page\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix the record count calculation for minor merges\&. This was leading to no Bloom filter being created for minor merges after running for some time, leading to merges taking increasingly long to complete\&.

Add sanity check of cache size to LSM open\&.

.PP
[#321] Bulk-cursors no longer block checkpoints\&. We can't write files that are being bulk-loaded, so change checkpoint to create checkpoints in the metadata that, if accessed, look like empty files\&.
.PP
Tighten down the requirements for bulk-load, the only thing that can be bulk-loaded now is a newly created tree, not any empty file\&.
.PP
[#329] Add dictionary support to variable-length column store objects\&. Support large row-store reconciliation dictionaries: add a skiplist as the indexing mechanism\&.

.PP
[#276] Fix methods that return integer parameters from Python\&. This includes cursor\&.equals and cursor\&.search_near\&.
.PP
[#277] Acquire the schema lock when creating the metadata file\&. We're single-threaded, so it isn't protecting against anything, but the handle management code expects to have the schema lock\&.

[#279] Some optimizations for __wt_config_gets_defno\&. Specifically, if we're dealing with a simple stack of config strings, just parse the application string rather than the full list of defaults\&.
.PP
[#279] Split the description string into a set of structures, to reduce the number of string comparisons and manipulation that's required\&.

If a page selected for eviction cannot be freed because it has some recent updates, try instead to free memory by trimming old updates\&.

Instead of flagging the empty tree's leaf page empty as part of creating an empty tree in memory, set the page as modified (to force reconciliation); if the leaf page is still empty at that time, then we'll figure it out during that reconciliation\&.

.PP
[#138] Add support for transactions with coarse-grained durability\&. Transactions provide atomicity guarantees and rollback, and uncommitted changes are never written to disk\&. There is no on-disk log, so committed changes only become durable when the next checkpoint completes\&.

Fix an eviction bug introduced into 1\&.1\&.2: when evicting a page with children, remove the children from the LRU eviction queue\&. Reduce the impact of clearing a page from the LRU queue by marking pages on the queue with a flag (WT_PAGE_EVICT_LRU)\&.
.PP
During an eviction walk, pin pages up to the root so there is no need to spin when attempting to lock a parent page\&. Use the EVICT_LRU page flag to avoid putting a page on the LRU queue multiple times\&.
.PP
Layer dump cursors on top of any cursor type\&.
.PP
Add a section on replacing the default system memory allocator to the tuning page\&.
.PP
Typo in usage method for 'wt write'\&.
.PP
Don't report range errors for config values that aren't well-formed integers\&.

.PP
Add public-domain copyright notices to the extension code\&.
.PP
test/format can now run multi-threaded, fixed two bugs it found: (1) When iterating backwards through a skiplist, we could race with an insert\&. (2) If eviction fails for a page, we have to assume that eviction has unlocked the reference\&.
.PP
Scan row-store leaf pages twice when reading to reduce the overhead of the index array\&.
.PP
Eviction race fixes: (1) Call __rec_review with WT_REFs: don't look at the page until we've checked the state\&. (2) Clear the eviction point if we hit it when discarding a child page, not just the parent\&.
.PP
Eviction tuning changes, particularly for read-only, out-of-cache workloads\&.
.PP
Only notify the eviction server if an application thread doesn't find any pages to evict, and then only once\&.
.PP
Only spin on the LRU lock if there might be pages in the LRU queue to evict\&.
.PP
Keep the current eviction point in memory and make the eviction walk run concurrent with LRU eviction\&.
.PP
Every test now has err/out captured, and it is checked to assure it is empty at the end of every test\&.

.PP
Default to a verbose build: that can be switched off by running \fCconfigure --enable-silent-rules\fP)\&.
.PP
Account for all memory allocated when reading a page into cache\&. Total memory usage is now much closer to the cache size when using many small keys and values\&.
.PP
Have application threads trigger a retry forced page eviction rather than blocking eviction\&. This allows rec_evict\&.c to simply set the WT_REF state to WT_REF_MEM after all failures, and fixes a bug where pages on the forced eviction queue would end up with state WT_REF_MEM, meaning they could be chosen for eviction multiple times\&.
.PP
Grow existing scratch buffers in preference to allocating new ones\&.
.PP
Fix a race between threads reading in and then modifying a page\&.
.PP
Get rid of the pinned flag: it is no longer used\&.
.PP
Fix a race where btree files weren't completely closed before they could be re-opened\&. This behavior can be triggered by using a new session on every operation (see the new -S flag to the test/thread program)\&. [#178]
.PP
When connections are closed, create a session and discard the btree handles\&. This fixes a long-standing bug in closing a connection: if for any reason there are btree handles still open, we need a real session handle to close them\&.
.PP
Really close btree handles: otherwise we can't safely remove or rename them\&. Fixes test failures in test_base02 (among others)\&.
.PP
Wait for application threads in LRU eviction to drain before walking a file\&.
.PP
Fix a buffer size calculation when updating the root address of a file\&.
.PP
Documentation fix: 10% of 1MB is 100KB\&.
.PP
.SS "WiredTiger release 1\&.1\&.0, 2012-02-28 "
.PP
Add checks to the session\&.truncate method to ensure the start/stop cursors reference the same object and have been initialized\&.
.PP
Implement cursor duplication via \fBWT_SESSION::open_cursor\fP\&. [#161]
.PP
Switch to quiet builds by default\&.
.PP
Fix with automake version < 1\&.11, use foreign mode so that fewer top-level files are required\&.
.PP
If a session or connection method is about to return WT_NOTFOUND (some underlying object was not found), map it to ENOENT, only cursor methods return WT_NOTFOUND\&. [#163]
.PP
Save and restore session->btree in schema ops to simplify calling code\&. [#164]
.PP
Note the wiredtiger_open config string 'multiprocess' is not yet supported\&.
.PP
Move 'root:F' and 'version:F' entries for files into the value for 'file:F', so there is only a single record per file\&. [NOTE: SCHEMA CHANGE]
.PP
When parsing config strings, continue to the end of the string in case of repeated keys\&. [#124]
.PP
Don't require shared libraries unless Python is configured\&.
.PP
Add support for direct I/O, with the config 'direct_io=(data,log)'\&. Build with _GNU_SOURCE on Linux to enable O_DIRECT\&.
.PP
Don't keep the last page of column stores pinned: it prevented eviction of large trees created from scratch\&.
.PP
Allow application threads to evict pages from any tree: maintain a count of threads doing LRU in each tree and wait for activity to drain when closing\&.
