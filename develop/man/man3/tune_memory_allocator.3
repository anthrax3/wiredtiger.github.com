tune_memory_allocator \- Memory allocator 
The performance of WiredTiger applications, especially heavily-threaded applications can be dominated by memory allocation because the WiredTiger engine frees and re-allocates memory as part of many queries\&. Replacing the system's malloc implementation with one that has better threaded performance (for example, \fCGoogle's tcmalloc\fP, or \fCFreeBSD's jemalloc\fP), can dramatically improve throughput\&.
.PP
As different memory allocators have different overhead and different workloads will have different heap allocation sizes and patterns, applications may need to set their allocator overhead using the \fCcache_overhead\fP configuration to the wiredtiger_open:: call\&.
