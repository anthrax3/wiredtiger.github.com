.SH "Database directory permissions"
.PP
By default, WiredTiger files are stored beneath the database home directory\&. The WiredTiger database directory should have its permissions set to ensure database objects are not accessible to users without appropriate permissions\&. See \fBDatabase Home Directory\fP for more information\&.
.SH "Absolute paths"
.PP
WiredTiger prepends the name of the database home to file names which do not appear to be absolute paths\&. (The absolute path test is simplistic, matching a leading slash character on POSIX systems or a leading alphabetic character and colon on Windows\&.) No file path sanitization or validation is done by WiredTiger, for example, file paths may match universal naming conventions (UNC), or include \fC'\&.\&./'\fP (dot dot slash) components\&.
.PP
Applications are responsible for validating user-supplied file paths as necessary to prevent directory traversal attacks\&.
.SH "File permissions"
.PP
WiredTiger creates file system objects readable and writable by the process owner, group and user, as modified by the process' umask value\&. The group ownership of created file system objects may vary depending on the system, and is not controlled by WiredTiger\&.
.SH "Environment variables"
.PP
Consider security when configuring WiredTiger to use the WIREDTIGER_HOME environment variable, especially in applications which run with permissions other than the user's\&. Such applications are potentially vulnerable to allowing users access to databases they could not otherwise access\&. See \fBDatabase Home Directory\fP for more information\&.
