shared_cache_lang_java \- Per-process shared caches in Java 
WiredTiger supports sharing a single cache among multiple databases within a process\&.
.PP
An application configures a shared cache by specifying a shared_cache name to the \fCwiredtiger\&.open\fP function\&. Applications can optionally set a minimum amount of cache any connection in the pool will be assigned and the granularity at which the cache pool is redistributed among connections - called the chunk size\&.
.PP
The shared cache implementation assigns a certain amount of cache to each participating database\&. Each database manages its allocated cache as it would when not using a shared cache - thus databases using a shared cache can have different eviction policies\&. There is a thread that monitors the cache usage of each database and redistributes the cache among participants according to where it is most likely to improve performance\&. The cache is redistributed in chunks which are of a configurable size\&. Once a database has had a chunk of cache added or removed it will be given time to start effectively using that cache before it is considered for further adjustment\&. If a small chunk size is configured it will take longer for the shared cache to adjust to changes in participants\&. Reallocation of resources happens periodically and whenever a database joins the shared cache\&.
.PP
The reallocation of resources is determined by comparing the amount of eviction activity in a particular database to that of the other participating databases\&.
.PP
When a database is opened it will be allocated the amount of cache configured as the shared cache minimum, regardless of whether the cache pool is currently fully utilized\&. Other databases will have their assigned cache size reduced so the total cache size used will return within the bounds - there may be a period when the actual usage exceeds the configured maximum\&. This is especially likely if many databases join the shared cache in a short period\&. When a database is closed any resources it is using are distributed among the other databases\&.
.PP
WiredTiger shared cache tuning options can be configured when first opening a database via \fCwiredtiger\&.open\fP or changed after open using the Connection\&.reconfigure method\&.
