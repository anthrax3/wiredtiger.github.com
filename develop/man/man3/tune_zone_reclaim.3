tune_zone_reclaim \- Linux zone reclamation memory management 
The performance of WiredTiger applications can be sensitive to the zone reclamation algorithms used in Linux Non Uniform Memory Management (NUMA)\&. Details of NUMA with specific reference to Linux can be found in the ACM Queue article \fCNUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access): An Overview\fP, by Christoph Lameter\&. If a WiredTiger database cache is assigned a significant proportion of system memory, it will likely be beneficial to disable zone reclamation\&. Zone reclamation can be disabled by running the following command as the root user:
.PP
.PP
.nf
echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode
.fi
.PP
