WiredTiger objects may be stored on remote file systems if the remote file system conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (POSIX\&.1)\&. In the case of read-only objects, multiple systems may access the objects simultaneously; objects which are written cannot be accessed by more than a single system\&. Because remote file systems are often slower than local file systems, using a remote file system for storage may degrade performance\&.
