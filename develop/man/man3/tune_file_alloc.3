tune_file_alloc \- File allocation 

.SH "File growth"
.PP
It's faster on some filesystems to grow a file in chunks rather than to extend it a block at a time as new blocks are written\&. By configuring the wiredtiger_open functions \fCfile_extend\fP value, applications can grow files ahead of the blocks being written\&.

            home, NULL, "create,file_extend=(data=16MB)", &conn);
.fi
.PP
 The system calls used to extend files in chunks on some systems require locking across the system call, which may decrease performance\&. Before configuring a \fCfile_extend\fP value, before and after throughput should be carefully evaluated\&.
.SH "File block allocation"
.PP
By default, when file blocks are being reused, WiredTiger attempts to avoid file fragmentation by selecting the smallest available block rather than splitting a larger available block into two\&. The \fCblock_allocation\fP configuration string to \fBWT_SESSION::create\fP can be set to \fCfirst\fP to change the algorithm to first-fit, that is, take the first available block in the file\&. Applications where file size is more of an issue than file fragmentation (for example, applications with fixed-size blocks) might want to configure this way\&.
