cursor_random_lang_java \- Cursor random in Java 
The \fCnext_random\fP configuration to the Session\&.open_cursor method configures the cursor to return a pseudo-random record from a row-store object\&.
.PP
The ability to return a random record was added to support a particular application, and as a result has somewhat unusual semantics\&. First, the returned record may not be random at all in the case of objects with only a few rows (especially when the object has never been written to the backing store)\&. In such objects, the Cursor\&.next method for cursors configured with \fCnext_random\fP may return the same row on each call\&. Additionally, even in larger objects, the Cursor\&.next method usually returns the first record from a random page in the underlying file, not a random record from a random page\&.
